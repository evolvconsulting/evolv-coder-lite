/**
 * Regression test for bug #2686
 *
 * The ecl-code-fixer agent (spawned by /ecl-code-review-fix) operated directly
 * against the main working tree. When it ran concurrently with a foreground
 * session both processes raced for HEAD, the index, and on-disk files. The
 * foreground session's next commit could land on the wrong branch (whichever
 * branch the agent last checked out).
 *
 * Fix: the agent's working instructions must include `git worktree add` as the
 * FIRST git operation, run ALL subsequent git operations inside that worktree
 * path, and call `git worktree remove` for cleanup when done.
 *
 * This mirrors the pattern already used by every other per-issue eCL agent at
 * /private/tmp/sv-<n>.
