# How to update eCL Core

Update an existing eCL Core install to the latest release, preview the changelog before committing, and recover any local customisations that the update would overwrite.

**What you need:** The same runtime eCL is installed for. The update command re-runs the installer under the hood, so it needs Node.js and npx available (same requirement as the original install).

---

## The standard update path

From inside your AI runtime, run:

```bash
/ecl-update
```

eCL will:

1. Detect the installed version and install scope (global or local).
2. Check npm for the latest release of `@evolvconsulting/evolv-coder-lite`.
3. Fetch the changelog and show you what changed between your installed version and the latest.
4. Ask for confirmation before touching anything.
5. Back up any user-added files found inside eCL-managed directories to `ecl-user-files-backup/`.
6. Run the installer (`npx @evolvconsulting/evolv-coder-lite@latest --<runtime> --<scope>`).
7. Clear the update-check cache so the statusline indicator resets.
8. Report whether locally modified eCL files were backed up to `ecl-local-patches/`.

Restart your runtime after the update to pick up new commands and agents.

## Flags

| Flag | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `--sync` | After updating, sync skills from the eCL registry |
| `--reapply` | After updating, merge locally modified eCL files back in from `ecl-local-patches/` |
| `--next` / `--rc` | Target the `@next` RC dist-tag instead of `@latest` (installs or refreshes a release candidate; see ADR #660) |

```bash
/ecl-update --sync        # Update and sync skills
/ecl-update --reapply     # Update and reapply local patches
/ecl-update --next        # Install from the @next RC dist-tag
```

---

## Install or refresh a release candidate

eCL publishes release candidates on the `@next` npm dist-tag (established by ADR #660). To install or refresh from that channel:

```bash
/ecl-update --next
# or equivalently:
/ecl-update --rc
```

The full update flow applies — scope/runtime detection, changelog preview, custom-file backup, and cache clearing all run normally. The only difference is that `check-latest-version.cjs` resolves the `@next` tag and npx installs from `@evolvconsulting/evolv-coder-lite@next`.

Only `latest` and `next` are supported channels; no arbitrary dist-tag can be passed (the script enforces an allowlist and exits with code 2 on an invalid tag).

Omitting `--next`/`--rc` keeps targeting `@latest` (stable channel, no change in behavior).

## Reviewing the changelog before updating

`/ecl-update` always shows the changelog diff between your installed version and the latest *before* it asks for confirmation. You do not need to visit GitHub separately. The output looks like:

```text
## eCL Update Available

Installed: 1.39.0
Latest:    1.41.0

### What's New
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[changelog entries for 1.40.0 and 1.41.0]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Proceed with update? [Yes, update now / No, cancel]
```

If the changelog cannot be fetched (no network access, npm outage), the update still proceeds after confirmation — it does not block on changelog availability.

## Recovering local customisations

### Files you added inside eCL-managed directories

If you placed custom files inside directories that eCL owns (for example, custom agents prefixed with `ecl-` or extra files in `commands/ecl/`), the installer will detect them and copy them to `ecl-user-files-backup/` before wiping those directories. After the update, restore them manually from that backup location.

Files you placed outside eCL-managed directories — custom agents not prefixed with `ecl-`, custom commands outside `commands/ecl/`, your `CLAUDE.md` files, and custom hooks — are never touched by the installer.

### eCL files you modified directly

If you edited a file that eCL installed (for example, tweaking an agent's system prompt), the installer detects the modification via a hash comparison against its manifest, backs the file up to `ecl-local-patches/`, and then replaces it with the new version. After the update:

```bash
/ecl-update --reapply
```

This merges your modifications from `ecl-local-patches/` back into the newly installed files.

If you skipped `--reapply` after a previous update and want to apply patches now:

```bash
/ecl-update --reapply
```

It is safe to run `--reapply` on its own without triggering a new download — if you are already on the latest version, eCL skips the install step and goes straight to reapplying patches.

## When npm is unavailable

If `npx @evolvconsulting/evolv-coder-lite@latest` fails due to an npm outage, network restrictions, or because you are working from the source repository, use the manual update procedure in [docs/manual-update.md](../manual-update.md). That document covers pulling the latest commit, building the hooks dist, and running `node bin/install.js` directly.

---

## If you are already on the latest version

`/ecl-update` exits early with a confirmation message — no download, no install, no restart needed.

---

## Installer migrations

Each eCL release may include installer migrations that rename, move, or retire managed files. The migration layer runs automatically before the new package payload is written. Migrations that would affect files you have modified prompt for confirmation rather than acting silently. For the full design and runtime-configuration contract registry, see [docs/installer-migrations.md](../installer-migrations.md).
